    <p>You're probably scared of sharks. Understandable, I'd get out of the water if I saw one at the beach. They are wild animals, and obviously pretty dangerous.</p>

    <p>Mainly this is because they have teeth for hands. They have no better way to tell what something is than to bite it. Their teeth have a lot of sensors to tell them the characteristics of the things they've bitten. This is both a good and a bad thing.</p>

    <p>Humans don't taste good to sharks. We are a high-cost, low-profit interaction for them. Actually, sharks almost never eat people. They take a test-bite, understand that we are both vicious and way too skinny, and swim away.</p>

    <p>We don't even look like food to them. There is a reason the most common shark attack victims are surfers. Surfers look like seals from below, and they tend to be out on the water during hunting time: dawn and dusk.</p>

    </p> Great White Sharks are a "vulnerable" species, due to things like people hunting them for trophies or not caring if they die because they've seen Jaws. As apex predators, they're also very susceptible to over-fishing.</p>

    <p>But the main reason it's a hard life being a shark: it takes an enormous amount of energy to keep them moving, and they have to move to pass oxygen over their gills... so they can breathe.</p> 

    </p>You may have heard that Great Whites are responsible for most fatal attacks on humans. But it's important to recognize that many of these reports come from victims who aren't trained to recognize the differences between shark species (and are hopped-up on adrenaline at the time of identification). </p>

    <p>Not everyone can be born with opposable thumbs. So if a shark decides to investigate you, which it probably won't because they are extremely cautious, you're probably going to lose a limb, but not your life.</p>

    <h3> TL;DR </h3>

    <p>Sharks are not that bad, and they donâ€™t want to eat you. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS-F4rfU4ns" id="bludkin">Period.</a></p>
